  // Funtions to get/set data in the cache.
  // Each one must provide a success and failure callback.
  // The request is run on the threadpool and the appropriate callback called.
  //
  // The result of a get request is provided as the argument to the success
  // callback. Ownership of pointer results is passed to the calling function.
  //
  // All put/delete operations take a progress callback as well as the success/
  // failure callbacks. The progress callback is called once the cache has
  // made enough progress that it can be called a success. However, it may still
  // have work to do after this point, and so the progress callback must not
  // delete the pointer that was put/deleted.
  // Once the progress callback returns, the cache continues doing whatever work
  // it deems necessary. Once it has finished, it returns and the success
  // callback is called. This is the point at which the caller can delete the
  // put/deleted object.
  //
  // If the request fails, the Store::Status code is provided as an argument to
  // the failure callback. The progress callback will not be called in a failure
  // scenario, so the failure callback must delete any put/deleted data.
  //
  // All requests optionally take a StopWatch*, which is passed to the HssCache
  // to allow it to pause the StopWatch when performing network I/O that
  // shouldn't count towards request latency.
