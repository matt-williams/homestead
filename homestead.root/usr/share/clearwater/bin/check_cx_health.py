# This poll script determines whether, during the "Previous 5 minutes" stat
# period, more than a configured threshold of Diameter request got rejected
# with "server" errors (i.e. errors which would have prompted Homestead to
# respond to the caller with a 5XX HTTP code) and NO requests succeeded over the
# same period.  monit responds to a positive response from this script by
# restarting homestead.
#
# The rationale for this function is that, if many diameter requests are failing
# with server errors and no requests are succeeding, this _might_ be because
# the Diameter stack is broken (rather than a genuine server or configuration
# issue) perhaps because freeDiameter failed to handle an unsual network
# failure and "hung" the Diameter connections.  In cases such as this, it is
# likely that service can be restored by restarting homestead, and there is no
# harm in trying this, as no requests are succeeding anyway.
#
# Note that the script does the stat lookup and calculation twice (and only
# responds in the positive if both checks suggest that the stack might be
# broken).  The reasoning here is that its not possible to check the "Previous
# 5 minute" value for all statistics atomically and therefore the values of
# some stats might be for a different 5 minute period.  If the script only
# checked once, it would be vulnerable to this "tick rollover" problem and
# might incorrectly identify the stack as needing a reboot, invalidly
# impacting service.

# This routine returns the number of "success" and "error" responses received
# over Cx over the previous 5 minute interval.
#
# By "success" here, we mean a response code that indicates that the request
# got to the server, not necessarily a success from an application PoV.  So,
# for instance, an experimental code that means "user not found" is actually a
# "success" because the fact that we got it means that the request did get to
# the server OK.
#
# The determination of success or error is done by appID and result code as
# follows
#
# -  Any EXPERIMENTAL (_3GPP) result code is considered a success (because
#    you can't get an experimental return code from the client stack)
# -  Any normal result code of the format 2XXX or 4XXX (e.g. 2001
#    - DIAMETER_SUCCESS or 4001 - DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED) is also
#    considered a success as you can only get these if the server has responded
# -  Anything else means we had an error code that might have come from the stack
#    having failed to contact the server, so is treated as an error
